2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell Impulse/Decode_reg[0]_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) Sel/Decode_reg[0]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell Impulse/Decode_reg[1]_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) Sel/Decode_reg[1]/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell Impulse/gtOp, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) Sel/Decode_reg[0]/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on Button_C relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on Button_L relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on Button_R relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on Reset relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LED[0] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LED[1] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#7 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LED[2] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#8 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LED[3] relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch MAE/FSM_sequential_EF_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin MAE/FSM_sequential_EF_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch MAE/FSM_sequential_EF_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin MAE/FSM_sequential_EF_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch Sel/Decode_reg[0]/L7 (in Sel/Decode_reg[0] macro) cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin Sel/Decode_reg[0]/L7/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch Sel/Decode_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin Sel/Decode_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
